# VisitPlan MVP — Product & Development Plan

**Version:** 2.4 (May 10, 2026)  
**Stack:** Expo React Native (SDK 55) + Cockpit CMS (cms.bimats.com)  
**Repo:** https://github.com/ThomasHeinThura/BIM.visitplan  
**Goal:** Unblock sales team — visit tracking + client management + management reports.

---

## Changelog — v2.4 (May 10, 2026)

| # | Change |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **Unified bottom nav across all roles:** `Today · Plan · Clients · Reports · Profile` (5 tabs). Team Overview and Admin moved out of nav for admin/management. |
| 2 | **Profile (S-12) now hosts "Admin Tools" card** — visible only to admin/management. Provides shortcut entries to Admin (S-09) and Team Overview (S-06). |
| 3 | **New screen S-13 — Edit Visit (Outcome & Status).** Reached from a 3-dot ⋮ menu on visit cards in Today (S-02), Plan (S-03), and Client Workspace (S-08). Edits status (Planned / Active / Done / No-show / Rescheduled / Cancelled), outcome (Positive / Neutral / Negative / No-show), pipeline value, notes, and reschedule date/time. Also exposes Delete. |
| 4 | **Reports (S-10) for AM/Sales/Solution — Teams tab removed.** They only see All / Mine. |
| 5 | **Reports (S-10) for Admin/Management — Teams tab navigates to a dedicated Team Report flow** (S-14 → S-15) instead of an inline list. |
| 6 | **New screen S-14 — Team Report.** Lists every AM in the current quarter with avatar, sector, client count, visit count, and pipeline. Sortable by Visits / Pipeline / Sector. Admin/management only. |
| 7 | **New screen S-15 — AM Visit List (drilldown from S-14).** Shows the selected AM's full visit list for the current quarter, grouped by date with status badges and outcomes. Filters: All / Done / Pending / No-show. |
| 8 | **Sales + Solution merged on the login screen** into a single "Sales / Solution" entry (the underlying roles remain distinct in RBAC). |
| 9 | **Admin Tools (S-09) simplified** — Sectors tab removed; "Create Sector" inlined into Tools. Sign Out card added to Tools. |
| 10 | **3-dot ⋮ menu on every visit card** in S-02, S-03, S-08 opens S-13 Edit Visit without disturbing card-level navigation. |

---

## Changelog — v2.3 (May 10, 2026)

| # | Change |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **Director + HOD merged into `management` role** — single role, group-scoped, admin-level permissions within their group |
| 2 | **5 roles total:** `admin`, `management`, `sales`, `solution`, `am` — simplified RBAC |
| 3 | **Management = admin-level but group-scoped** — can create clients/sectors, edit all client fields, create visit plans, view team overview, set sector owner — all within own group |
| 4 | **Sales + Solution = AM-equivalent but group-scoped** — Sales can create visit plans for own group; Solution can add agenda/participants; both see all group visits |
| 5 | **All roles can add participants and agenda items to any visit they can see** |
| 6 | **Target changed from MMK to USD** — `target_usd` field; default $30,000 |
| 7 | **Permission matrix simplified** to 5 columns (Admin / Management / Sales / Solution / AM) |
| 8 | **Seniority (junior/senior) applies to all non-admin roles** — management, sales, solution, am |
| 9 | **users collection updated** — `role` options: `admin`, `management`, `sales`, `solution`, `am`; `target_usd` default 30000 |
| 10 | **Visit visibility rules** — management sees all in group; sales/solution see all in group; am sees own only |


## Changelog — v2.2 (May 10, 2026)

| # | Change |
|---|--------|
| 1 | Full RBAC overhaul — 6 roles (superseded by v2.3) |
| 2 | Participants field on visits |
| 3 | AM is cross-department |
| 4–10 | See v2.3 for current state |

## Changelog — v2.1 (May 10, 2026)

| # | Change |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **New screen S-11 — Add Agenda Item** (dedicated agenda item editor for visits with many items) |
| 2 | **"Manager Instruction" renamed to "Instruction"** — only Admin can add instructions to a client |
| 3 | **Client Workspace screen updated** — shows total meetings + meeting outcomes for both AM & Admin |
| 4 | **Meeting Groups added** — Infra, ES, App, MS; Group Admin role can only see their group's meetings |
| 5 | **Client data model confirmed** — fields: Name, AM, Account Type, Sector, Status (with all enum values) |
| 6 | **New Profile screen (S-12)** — AM can edit their group, set personal target (default 240M MMK), see owned sectors |
| 7 | **Admin Teams screen (S-05) — navigation buttons added** |
| 8 | **Target field added to users** — 240M MMK default; shown in Profile & Reports |
| 9 | **Sector ownership** — each sector has an owner AM; visible in Profile screen |
| 10 | **Sector creation** — Admin + Management via Admin screen (Management: own group only); AM cannot create sectors |

---

## What We Are Building

1. **Mobile App** (iOS + Android + Web) — for Area Managers to plan and log visits
2. **Client Directory** — admin-managed, AM-viewable, with sector/status/type metadata
3. **Report Screen** (in-app) — visit counts per AM, weekly and monthly

Pipeline tracking is a **separate app**. Not in this MVP.

---

## Users & Roles

**5 roles.** `management` merges Director + HOD. `am` is cross-department. All group-scoped roles (`management`, `sales`, `solution`) are bound to one meeting group.

| Role | Bound To | What They See | Analogy |
|------|----------|---------------|---------|
| `admin` | — | Everything; manage all users, approve new users | System admin |
| `management` | Meeting Group | Admin-level within own group — all clients, all group visits, team overview, visit creation | Director / HOD |
| `sales` | Meeting Group | All visits in own group + participants; can create visit plans for own group | Group-scoped AM |
| `solution` | Meeting Group | All visits in own group + participants; add agenda/participants | Group-scoped AM |
| `am` | Clients + Sectors | Own visits + own clients; cross-department seller; added as participant to group visits | Field AM |

> **AM sells across all departments.** An AM visit to a Banking client may involve Infra, App, and Solution staff — all added as participants via the participant selector.

### Seniority

Applies to `management`, `sales`, `solution`, and `am`. Stored on the user record.

| Seniority | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `junior` | Standard access within their role/group |
| `senior` | Same access for MVP; future: mentee visibility, extended reporting |

### Meeting Groups

Every visit belongs to one meeting group. Users scoped to a group see only that group's visits (plus any visit where they are added as participant).

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `infra` | Infrastructure — Management, Sales, Solution |
| `es` | Enterprise Solutions — Management, Sales, Solution |
| `app` | Application — Management, Sales, Solution |
| `ms` | Managed Services — Management, Sales, Solution |

### Visit Visibility Rules

A user can see a visit if **any** of these is true:

1. They are the `assigned_am` on the visit
2. They are listed in the visit's `participants` array
3. Their role is `management`, `sales`, or `solution` and the visit's `meeting_group` matches their `meeting_group`
4. Their role is `admin`

This means a cross-department project meeting (e.g. Infra + App joint visit) is visible to participants from both groups.

### Permission Matrix

> **Management** = admin-level, own group only. **Sales / Solution** = AM-equivalent, own group instead of own clients.

| Action | Admin | Management | Sales | Solution | AM |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|----------|----|
| Create client | ✅ all | ✅ all | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create sector | ✅ all | ✅ all | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit client name / sector | ✅ all | ✅ all | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit client account_type / status | ✅ all | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ✅ own group | ✅ own clients |
| Assign AM to client | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Add / edit client **Instruction** | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View client Instruction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ read | ✅ read | ✅ read |
| Create visit plan | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ✅ own group | ✅ own group | ✅ own clients |
| Add participants to visit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add agenda item to visit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View visits | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ✅ own group | ✅ own group | ✅ own only |
| View team overview (S-05) | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Approve / reject users | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Access Admin screen (S-09) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Set sector owner | ✅ all | ✅ own group | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit own profile target (USD) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit own meeting group | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## Authentication — Microsoft Login

Users log in with their **Microsoft work account** (BIM Group Entra ID).  
Cockpit CMS stores user profile + role. Microsoft handles identity only.

**Flow:**
1. User taps "Login with Microsoft" → PKCE OAuth redirects to Entra ID
2. Microsoft returns token + user email + job title
3. App queries Cockpit `users` collection by `ms_email`
4. Not found → create pending record (`approval_status: pending`) → show **Pending Approval** screen (S-08)
5. Found, `approval_status = pending` → show **Pending Approval** screen (S-08)
6. Found, `role = am`, `approval_status = approved` → enter AM Today Dashboard (S-02)
7. Found, `role in [sales, solution, management]`, `approval_status = approved` → enter Group Today Dashboard (S-02)
8. Found, `role = admin`, `approval_status = approved` → enter Admin Today Dashboard (S-02)
9. Special case: job title contains "Director" or "HOD" → auto-assign `management` role + `approval_status: approved`
10. Special case: job title contains "Admin" → auto-assign `admin` role + `approval_status: approved`

**Admin approves users via:**
- **In-app**: Admin screen (S-09) → Approvals tab → assign role + seniority + meeting group (Admin: any role; Management: can approve within own group)
- **Cockpit CMS**: `users` collection → update `role` + `approval_status` fields directly

No passwords. No separate registration. Users sign in with Microsoft; admin assigns roles.

### Step 2 — Create Scoped API Key

**Settings → API Access → Add API Key**
- Name: `visitplan-mobile`
- Permissions: Read + Write on all 8 collections, Read on Assets
- Copy the key → add to app as `COCKPIT_API_TOKEN` in `.env`

**Do not use the Master API key in the mobile app.**

### Step 3 — Enable CORS

**Settings → Security → CORS**  
Add your app's domain and `*` for development.

---

## Mobile App — 16 Screens

### Bottom Navigation (v2.4)

All roles share the same 5-tab bottom navigation:

`Today (S-02)` · `Plan (S-03)` · `Clients (S-07)` · `Reports (S-10)` · `Profile (S-12)`

Role-specific surfaces are reached **inside** these tabs:

- **Admin / Management** open Admin (S-09) and Team Overview (S-06) from the **Admin Tools** card on Profile (S-12).
- **Admin / Management** open the Team Report flow (S-14 → S-15) from the **Teams** sub-tab on Reports (S-10). The Teams sub-tab is hidden for AM / Sales / Solution.
- **All roles** open Edit Visit (S-13) from the **⋮** menu on any visit card in S-02 / S-03 / S-08.

### Role → Screen Access

Screens adapt based on the user's role. The bottom navigation is the same for everyone; visible data and role-gated surfaces change per role.

| # | Screen | Who Can Access | Purpose |
|---|--------|----------------|---------|
| S-00 | Login | All | Microsoft SSO only — no email/password |
| S-01 | Pending Approval | New user | Shown after MS login if account not yet approved |
| S-02 | Today Dashboard | All approved | Today's visits (scoped by role), quick actions, KPIs. AM sees own; Sales/Solution/Management sees group; Admin sees all |
| S-03 | Visit Plan (Calendar & List) | All approved | Month calendar + daily visit list. Same scoping as S-02 |
| S-04 | Create / Edit Visit (Modal) | AM + Admin + Management + Sales | POPUP modal: client, meeting group, date/time, **participant selector** (multi-user from any group). AM limited to own clients; Sales/Management limited to own group |
| S-05 | Team Overview | Admin + Management | Admin: all groups; Management: own group only. Shows group members, visit counts, role/seniority badges |
| S-06 | Visit Detail / Active Visit | All approved | Check-in/out, agenda checklist (→ S-11), notes, start/finish. Participants listed. All roles can add agenda items and participants |
| S-07 | Client List | All approved | Full client directory; search + filter by sector/status/AM. AM sees own clients prominently |
| S-08 | Client Workspace / Detail | All approved | Client record, total meetings count, outcome summary. **Instruction tab** (admin-edit, all-read). Tabs: Overview / Instruction / Visits / Outcomes |
| S-09 | Admin Screen | Admin + Management | Tools + Approvals tab (set role + seniority + group) + Sector management. Management sees own group only |
| S-10 | Reports | All approved | AM: personal. Management: group. Admin: full team. Shows target (USD) vs. actuals |
| S-11 | Add / Edit Agenda Item | All approved | Dedicated screen from S-06. Add/edit/delete/reorder agenda items. Any participant or group-scoped user can add items |
| S-12 | Profile | All approved | View/edit: meeting group, seniority, personal target (USD), owned sectors (AM/Management), theme. **Admin Tools card** (admin/management only) links to S-09 and S-06. Sign out. |
| S-13 | Edit Visit | All approved | Opened from ⋮ menu on any visit card. Edit status, outcome, pipeline value, notes, reschedule date/time. Delete option. |
| S-14 | Team Report | Admin + Management | Reached from Teams sub-tab on S-10. Lists all AMs in current quarter with visit counts, pipeline, sector. Sort by Visits / Pipeline / Sector. |
| S-15 | AM Visit List | Admin + Management | Drilldown from S-14. Selected AM's Q visits with date, client, outcome, status. Filter All / Done / Pending / No-show. |

> S-04 is a modal overlay (not standalone navigation). S-11 pushes onto the navigation stack from S-06 (Visit Detail). S-13 is reached from the ⋮ menu on visit cards (S-02 / S-03 / S-08). S-14 is reached from the Teams sub-tab on S-10 and is admin/management only. S-15 is a drilldown from S-14.

---

### S-04 — Create / Edit Visit: Participant Selector

The Create Visit modal now includes a **Participants** field:

- **All roles can add participants** — AM, Sales, Solution, Management, Admin
- Multi-select from all active users in Cockpit
- Users can be from any meeting group — not restricted to visit's group
- Shown as avatar chips in the modal and in Visit Detail (S-06)
- Selected participants will see the visit in their feed even if it's in a different group
- Default: only the creator (auto-added)

Use case: An AM schedules a Banking client visit that needs Infra + App Solution staff — AM selects both as participants. Those users see the visit in their own Today/Plan screens.

Use case 2: A Sales user in Infra creates a group visit and adds a Management user and two Solution staff as participants.

---

### S-05 — Team Overview: Navigation & Scoping

The Teams screen is accessible to **Admin and Management** only.

- **Admin**: sees all groups, all AMs, all visits — can switch group filter
- **Management**: sees only their own group; sees their group's AMs, Sales, and Solution staff

Bottom navigation tabs (added in v2.1):

| Tab | Visible to |
|-----|------------|
| Today | All |
| Plan | All |
| Clients | All |
| Reports | All |

The Team Overview itself shows:
- Group filter (Admin: dropdown; Management: pre-locked to their group)
- Member list with role + seniority badges
- Today's visit count per member
- Weekly visit count per member

---

### S-08 — Client Workspace: New Sections

The Client Workspace screen now has these tabs/sections:

1. **Overview** — client info, assigned AM, sector, account type, status
2. **Instruction** — admin-managed instruction text. Admin can edit; AM/Group Admin sees read-only
3. **Visits** — total meeting count + list of recent visits with outcome badges
4. **Outcomes Summary** — aggregate: Positive / Neutral / Negative / No-show counts + % bar

---

### S-11 — Add / Edit Agenda Item (New)

Dedicated screen pushed from Visit Detail (S-06). Handles visits with many agenda items.

**Fields:**
- Title (text input)

- Delete item (swipe left)
- Reorder (drag handle)

Data saved to `agenda_items` collection linked to the visit.

---

---

### S-13 — Edit Visit (New, v2.4)

Opened from the **⋮** 3-dot menu on any visit card in S-02 (Today), S-03 (Plan), or S-08 (Client Workspace · Visits tab). The 3-dot tap stops propagation so the underlying card navigation is preserved.

**Fields:**
- **Status** — radio chips: `Planned` / `Active` / `Done` / `No-show` / `Rescheduled` / `Cancelled`
- **Outcome** — radio chips: `Positive` / `Neutral` / `Negative` / `No-show` (when status = Done)
- **Pipeline value (USD)** — numeric input, prefixed `$`
- **Outcome notes** — textarea
- **Reschedule** — date + time pickers (when status = Rescheduled)

**Actions:** Save · Cancel · Delete (red link).

---

### S-14 — Team Report (New, v2.4)

Admin / Management only. Reached from the **Teams** sub-tab on Reports (S-10).

**Header:** quarter label (e.g., `Q2 2026 · Apr–Jun · 12 AMs`), back arrow → S-10.

**KPI strip (3 cells):** total visits in Q · % completed · pipeline USD.

**Sort tabs:** `By Visits` (default) · `By Pipeline` · `By Sector`.

**List:** one row per AM — avatar, name, sector badge, client count, visits in Q, pipeline USD, chevron. Tap row → S-15.

---

### S-15 — AM Visit List (New, v2.4)

Drilldown from S-14. Shows the selected AM's complete visit list for the current quarter.

**Header:** back arrow → S-14, AM name, AM role/sector.

**Filters:** `All` (default) · `Done` · `Pending` · `No-show`.

**List:** date-grouped (This week, last week, monthly buckets) hist-items showing date, client, time + agenda summary, outcome line, status badge.

---

### Target: USD

Each user has a personal sales target stored as `target_usd` on the `users` record.  
Default: **$30,000 USD**.  
Any user can edit their own target from Profile (S-12). Shown in Reports (S-10) as progress bar vs. actuals.

## Cockpit API — How It Works

All endpoints use your scoped API key in the header:

```
Authorization: Api-Key YOUR_COCKPIT_API_TOKEN
```

### Key Endpoints

```
# Auth (not used — we use Microsoft, but available for fallback)
POST https://cms.bimats.com/api/user/login
  body: { user: "email", password: "pass" }

# Get visits (paginated)
GET  https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/items/visits
  ?limit=20&skip=0&sort[date]=-1

# Get visits by AM
GET  https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/items/visits
  ?filter[assigned_am._id]=USER_ID

# Create visit
POST https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/item/visits
  body: { data: { title, client, date, ... } }

# Update visit (check-in, status change)
POST https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/item/visits
  body: { data: { _id: "xxx", status: "in_progress", checkin_at: "..." } }

# Get user by MS email
GET  https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/items/users
  ?filter[ms_email]=user@bimgroup.com&limit=1

# Create outcome
POST https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/item/visit_outcomes
  body: { data: { visit: { _id: "..." }, result: "positive", ... } }

# Report: all visits in date range
GET  https://cms.bimats.com/api/content/items/visits
  ?filter[date][$gte]=2026-05-01&filter[date][$lte]=2026-05-31
  &limit=500&fields=date,status,assigned_am
```

## Microsoft Entra ID Setup (Azure Portal)

1. Go to **portal.azure.com → Entra ID → App Registrations → New Registration**
2. Name: `VisitPlan Mobile`
3. Supported account types: **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (single tenant)
4. Redirect URI: `msauth://com.bimgroup.visitplan/callback` (Android) + `msauth.com.bimgroup.visitplan://auth` (iOS)
5. After creation → **API Permissions → Add → Microsoft Graph → Delegated:**
   - `User.Read` (profile info)
   - `email`, `openid`, `profile` (basic OIDC)
6. Copy **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** → add to app config

No client secret needed for mobile (public client flow).

## Report Screen — What Managers See

```
Weekly Report: May 5–11, 2026
─────────────────────────────────────────
AM Name          Visits   Completed   Missed
Thomas H.          8         7          1
Kyaw Z.            7         6          1
Aung M.            7         7          0

[Bar chart: visits per AM this month]

Outcome Summary (completed visits):
  Positive  ████████░░  68%
  Neutral   ████░░░░░░  22%
  Negative  ██░░░░░░░░  10%
```

Filter controls: This Week / This Month / Custom Range  
Data source: Cockpit `visits` collection filtered by date range, grouped by `assigned_am`

---

## Admin Screen — S-09 (Admin + Management)

The Admin screen has three tabs. **Management access is group-scoped** — they can approve users, create clients/sectors, and set sector owners, but only within their own meeting group. Admin has no scoping.

The Admin screen has three tabs:

**Tools tab:**
- Create Client — name, sector (dropdown from `sectors`), account_type, status, assign AM, meeting group
- Create Sector — name + optional owner AM (Admin: globally; Management: own group)
- Assign sector owner — pick sector → pick AM

**Approvals tab:**
- Lists users with `approval_status = pending`
- Shows: name, MS email, job title (from Entra ID)
- Approve action: select **Role** (`am` / `sales` / `solution` / `management` / `admin`) + **Seniority** (junior / senior) + **Meeting Group** (`infra` / `es` / `app` / `ms`, if applicable)
- Confirm → sets `approval_status: approved` on the user record
- Approved users immediately get app access

**Sectors tab:**
- List all sectors with owner AM name
- Edit sector name or owner
- Create new sector

Admin can also deactivate users via Cockpit CMS (`active: false`) → immediate loss of access.

## MVP Delivery Timeline

### Week 1 — Foundation
- [ ] Cockpit collections created (Day 1)
- [ ] API key created and tested with Postman/curl
- [ ] Entra ID app registration completed
- [ ] Packages installed in Expo repo
- [ ] `cockpit.ts` + `auth.ts` + `storage.ts` written
- [ ] Login screen working (Microsoft login → user lookup)
- [ ] Home screen + Visit List screen (read from Cockpit)

### Week 2 — Core Visit Flow
- [ ] Visit Detail screen
- [ ] Visit Create screen (form + submit to Cockpit)
- [ ] Check-in screen (GPS + status update)
- [ ] Check-out + Outcome form (submit + lock)
- [ ] Client List + Client Detail screens

### Week 3 — Report + Admin + UAT
- [ ] Report screen (chart + table)
- [ ] User Management screen (admin)
- [ ] Role-based navigation (AM vs Manager vs Admin views)
- [ ] UAT with sales team (3–5 AMs)
- [ ] Bug fixes + deploy to TestFlight (iOS) + APK (Android)

**Total: 3 weeks, 1 developer**

## What Is NOT in This MVP

These are deferred to Phase 2:

- Recurring visit templates — Phase 2
- Route planning / map view — Phase 2
- Push notifications (overdue alerts) — Phase 2
- Offline mode (sync queue) — Phase 2
- Pipeline / deals tracking — separate app entirely
- WSO2 IS / APIM integration — UAT demo environment only
- Management KPI dashboard (web) — Phase 2
- Excel / PDF report export — Phase 2
- Mentee / senior visibility rules for sales seniority — Phase 2
- Multi-group Management (management scoped to 2+ groups simultaneously) — Phase 2; for MVP Management is bound to one group

> **Moved INTO MVP from Phase 2:** Agenda Items (S-11), Client Instruction field, Meeting Groups, Profile screen (S-12), expanded RBAC (5 roles), Participants on visits.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cockpit CORS blocks mobile app calls | High | Configure CORS in Cockpit settings on Day 1, test before writing screens |
| MSAL redirect URI mismatch on device | Medium | Test auth on real device in Week 1, not emulator |
| Cockpit collection links (populate) not returning nested data | Medium | Use `populate=1` query param on collection requests |
| Manager report slow with 500+ visits | Low for MVP | Add `limit` + date filter, acceptable for 100 users |
| Admin forgets to create user before AM tries to log in | Medium | Show clear "contact admin" message on login failure |
